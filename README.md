## Hello there, I'm Tevi üëã
Welcome to my GitHub where I usually create projects to test my ideas


## :pencil2: About me
I'm a Software Engineer with 3 years of experience. I have worked as a Full Stack Developer, Backend and currently I'm covering a Frontend role. 

I do find every role interesting, that's why I have been fitting almost every role. Actually that's what I learnt in college, I do not fall in love with any language, I just want to use which fits better to solve the problem my team has.

Last but not least, it is important to mention that I do believe that our job works in hand with team work. I think it is essential to be a great developer as thoroughly a person who can assist their colleagues.
